# Overview
This is application extends **search_feature_2** in order to test:
+ Is search functionality affected when running searches on a parent model when the search values are foreign keys that reference attributes of a child model, when both the parent and child models use STI.
+ Once I establish that STI has no affect on the search feature, I want to test dynamic multistep forms.
+ Is there a difference in creating the associations in the parent class vs subclass?
